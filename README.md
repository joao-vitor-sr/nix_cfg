# Nix Configration
This is my personalized Nix configuration, tailored to suit my specific needs and preferences rather than aiming for widespread popularity. As a result, there are elements included that are specifically chosen for my individual use case.

## Installation:
To begin, integrate the 'common.nix' file into your 'configuration.nix'. Please be aware that this configuration relies on the unstable channel, so ensure you incorporate that as well.
