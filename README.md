# Nix Configration
This is my personalized Nix configuration, tailored to suit my specific needs and preferences rather than aiming for widespread popularity. As a result, there are elements included that are specifically chosen for my individual use case.

## Installation:
To set up, simply include the 'common.nix' file in your 'configuration.nix'."
